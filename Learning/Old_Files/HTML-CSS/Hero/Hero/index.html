                Every month, we send an email that’s designed to keep you
                up-to-date on crypto tax news. And because we like having fun, we
                also include one crypto meme that made our team laugh. So, sit
                back, relax, and enjoy this newsletter (and don’t miss out on this
                month’s product tip that may help you save thousands of dollars
                on your tax bill!)

                    This month, the House passed an infrastructure
                    bill that adds more tax reporting provisions for
                    cryptocurrency brokers. You may remember
                    prominent crypto companies lobbying against an
                    earlier version of the bill a few months ago — but
                    some experts say that the final form has even
                    worse implications for the crypto ecosystem.

                    Every month, we sit down with Jordan Bass, our
                    Head of Tax Strategy, a Certified Public
                    Accountant, and a Tax Attorney. This month, he’ll
                    break down the crypto tax implications of the new
                    infrastructure bill and what it means for investors
                    like you. He’ll also take some time to answer
                    questions from the audience!
